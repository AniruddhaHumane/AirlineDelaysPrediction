# Weather induced Airlines Delays Prediction using Machine Learning

Mar 2017 – Mar 2017

Project descriptionThe primary goal of model proposed in this Project is to predict airline delays caused by inclement of weather conditions using data mining and supervised machine learning algorithm (Random Forest). 2008 US domestic flight data and weather data was extracted for training and prediction. Four different models were developed to for analysis of behavior of different parameters. Departure and Arrival delays were separately determined. Sampling techniques (SMOTE) were then applied on data to improve the performance of model. Every model’s performance was compared using precision, recall, F1 score, Accuracy, Confusion matrix, and AUC under ROC.
